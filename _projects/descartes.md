This project is part of my graduate applied cryptography course taught by Prof. Chester Rebeiro in Jan-May 2017 semester.
In this project, I wrote a new cipher called "Descartes," named after the French mathematician and philosopher Ren√© Descartes.
The cipher is a Feistel cipher that uses a 128-bit key and runs in 7 rounds.
The cipher also uses four different 16-by-4 strongly-linear compression s-boxes.
These s-boxes take 96-bit sub-key as input and do not obey the SAC property.
The cipher also utilizes a 96-by-64 diffusion layer.

Looking at the picture, each round in the encryption layer uses $$L_{i+1} = R_i$$ & $$R_{i+1} = L_i \oplus F(R_i, K_i)$$, whereas the decryption layer uses $$R_i = L_{i+1}$$ & $$L_i = R_{i+1} \oplus F(L_{i+1}, K_i)$$.
I implemented the cipher and checked the non-linearity of s-boxes by calculating its similarity with any affine transformations.
The linear approximations, differential approximations, and timing attack information are also present in the repo.
