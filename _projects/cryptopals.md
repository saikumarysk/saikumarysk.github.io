CryptoPals Challenges are online challenges that have been around since 2014 and provide a comprehensive list of problems that reflect the real-world attacks on many heuristic-based and provably secure cryptographic algorithms used even now.
I always wanted to find out how the mathematically developed cryptographic theory in several academic papers is implemented in real-world protocols.
Although I was part of several software security projects at Oracle R&D India, most of them did not involve any cryptography.
These challenges provided me with a way to improve my understanding of several cryptographic schemes and the nitty-gritties required to put them into practice.

These are my solutions for the famous CryptoPals challenges in Python 3.
I have been busy with coursework and other commitments, so the code is not that modular, pretty, or easy to understand.
I will do the refactoring sometime in the future.
I am yet to finish Set 8.
