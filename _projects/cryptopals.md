These are my solutions for the famous CryptoPals challenges.
These online problems provide a comprehensive list of problems that reflect the real-world attacks on many heuristic-based and provably secure cryptographic algorithms used even now.
These challenges have been around since 2014, and these are my solutions for the problems in Python 3.
I have been busy with coursework and other commitments, so the code is not that modular, pretty, or easy to understand.
I will do refactoring sometime in the future.
Week 8 is yet to be finished.
